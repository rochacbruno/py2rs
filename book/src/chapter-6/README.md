## Facts

- The language is named **Rust** because **"rust is as close to the bare metal as you can get".**,   
  in metal theory **rust** is the chemical layer closest to bare metal.  
  (also [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)) says that the name was *possibly* inspired by the name of a Fungi)
- The Rust `trifecta` is 1) **Memory Safe**, 2) **Fast** 3) **Concurrent**
- [Rust can be used for web development](http://www.arewewebyet.org/)
- [Rust can be used for Gaming Development](http://arewegameyet.com/)
- [Rust can be used for Machine Learning](http://www.arewelearningyet.com/)
- [Lots of IDEs and Editors supports Rust](https://areweideyet.com/)
  ([VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kalitaalexey.vscode-rust) is known to have the better support by now)
- Rust packages are called `Crates` and are installed by `Cargo` explore them at [http://crates.io](http://crates.io)
- In Rust there is no **Class** but **Structs**, **Enums**, **Traits**, **functions** and **macros!**
- Rust compiler was first written in **OCaml** then rewritten in Rust! (Rust is written in Rust!!!)
- Rust type system is strongly inspired by **Haskell**
- Rust **functional** style is inspired by **Erlang**
- Rust type inference is mainly inspired by **ML** and also by **Haskell**
- The main **syntax** style is inspired by **C** and **C++**
- There is no automated **Garbage Collector** so Rust frees memory based on Resource Aquisition RAII (a.k.a Ownership)
- Rust has **Generic Types**!!!
- As **Rust** is **close to bare metal** you can ship a program without the inclusion of **Rust's runtime** which makes easy to distribute programs (no need of dependencies and virtuelenvs management)
- Graydon Hoare (creator of Rust) is now working at **Apple** developing the **Swift** language
- Rust is the developers **most loved language** according to **Stack Overflow Survey**
- Rust is the most [**energy efficient**](https://sites.google.com/view/energy-efficiency-languages/results) language! and that is very important for environment, data center companies and maybe it can help saving your laptop and phone battery in near future. 
- There is an Operating System written in **Rust** - [Redox](https://www.redox-os.org/)
- Mozilla released the fastest version of Firefox (**quantum**) having many parts written on **Rust**
- The [Rust mascot (unofficial)](http://www.rustacean.net/) is called **Ferris** and it is a **crab**
  (There is no record of the official reason about being a crab, the reasonable history is that it was inspired by the **Rusty Crab** 
   a common species of crab and also a name of a famous restaurant.)
- To compliment your fellow Rustaceans don't say **~~cheers!~~**. Say **safe!** (**safe!** is also said when toasting with champagne at Rust conferences)
- Rust is to become a second programming language for the Linux kernel (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_for_Linux))
- Rust is the language choosen by Microsoft to rewrite parts of Windows Kernel
